2. Write a program in which create a function that takes three numbers and prints the second max.
 program:

  function isPrime(n){
    var i,j;
    for(i=2;i<=n;i++){
        count=0;
        if(i==2){
            console.log(i,'is Prime Number');// 2 is prime number
        }
        for( j=2;j<=i/j;j++){
            if(i%j==0){
                count=count+1;
                console.log(i,'is not Prime Number')
                break;
            }
        }
        if(count==0 && i!=j ){
            console.log(i,'is Prime Number')
        }
    }
    return 0;
}isPrime(100)

//As a variation, make changes to use the Anonymous Function and store it in variable to call it.
 program:
 
 let isPrime=function(n){
    var i,j;
    for(i=2;i<=n;i++){
        count=0;
        if(i==2){
            console.log(i,'is Prime Number');// 2 is prime number
        }
        for( j=2;j<=i/j;j++){
            if(i%j==0){
                count=count+1;
                console.log(i,'is not Prime Number')
                break;
            }
        }
        if(count==0 && i!=j ){
            console.log(i,'is Prime Number')
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
isPrime(100) 

//As a variation, make changes to use Arrow Function.
program:

 let isPrime=(n)=>{
    var i,j;
    for(i=2;i<=n;i++){
        count=0;
        if(i==2){
            console.log(i,'is Prime Number');// 2 is prime number
        }
        for( j=2;j<=i/j;j++){
            if(i%j==0){
                count=count+1;
                console.log(i,'is not Prime Number')
                break;
            }
        }
        if(count==0 && i!=j ){
            console.log(i,'is Prime Number')
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
isPrime(100)
